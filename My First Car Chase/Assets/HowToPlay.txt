Goal:
Drive as far as possible!
If you hit a police car or a spike mat, you will lose.
If your speed reaches 0, you lose.

Gearing:
Press and hold down the 'Space' key on the keyboard to enable gearing. Imagine you are pressing down the clutch in your car.
While holding down the 'Space' key, use the arrow keys to move the gear stick. The green circle on the dashboard indicates what gear
you are in. When you have moved to the selected gear, release the space key.
Higher gear = higher speed.
Higher gear = bonus points.

While the space key is being pressed, or you put the car in neutral, no points are generated and the car will slow down.
Upon reaching a speed of '0', you will lose the game.
